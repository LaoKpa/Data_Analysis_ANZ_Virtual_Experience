# Data@ANZ Virtual Experience Program

Participated in the Data@ANZ Virtual Experience Program to gain more knowledge of how data is utilised in banks. 

For task 1, I decided to use Python3 for my data cleaning and vizualization purposes as I think I am comfortable using Python.

On hindsight, python programming language and data visualisation tools has its own pros and cons. Python is more flexible, which makes data cleaning much faster. On the other hand, I sorely missed the drag and drop features of visualisation tools, which would come in handy when developing the visualisations.

Feel free to drop any feedback, suggestions/contributions are always welcomed :-)
Happy Programming !!
